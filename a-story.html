    <p>
      A Solar panels (also known as "PV panels") is a device that converts light
      from the sun, which is composed of particles of energy called "photons",
      into electricity that can be used to power electrical loads. Solar panels
      can be used for a wide variety of applications including remote power
      systems for cabins, telecommunications equipment, remote sensing, and of
      course for the production of electricity by residential and commercial
      solar electric systems. On this page,
      <em
        >we will discuss the history, technology, and benefits of solar
        panels</em
      >. We will learn how solar panels work, how they are made, how they create
      electricity, and where you can buy solar panels.

    <h2>A Short History of Solar Panels</h2>
    <p class="a">
      The development of solar energy goes back more than 100 years. In the
      early days, solar energy was used primarily for the production of steam
      which could then be used to drive machinery. But it wasn't until the
      discovery of the "photovoltaic effect" by Edmond Becquerel that would
      allow the conversion of sunlight solar electric energy. Becquerel's
      discovery then led to the invention in 1893 by Charles Fritts of the first
      genuine solar cell which was formed by coating sheets of selenium with a
      thin layer of gold. <span>And from this humble beginning would arise the device
      we know today as the solar panel.</span> Russel Ohl, an American inventor on the
      payroll of Bell Laboratories, patented the world's first silicon solar
      cell in 1941. Ohl's invention led to the production of the first solar
      panel in 1954 by the same company. <strong>Solar panels found their first
      mainstream use in space satellites. For most people, the first solar panel
      in their life was probably embedded in their new calculator - circa the
      1970s! Today, solar panels and complete solar panel systems are used to
      power a wide variety of applications.</strong> Yes, solar panels in the form of
      solar cells are still being used in calculators. However, they are also
      being used to provide solar power to entire homes and commercial
      buildings, such as Google's headquarters in California.
